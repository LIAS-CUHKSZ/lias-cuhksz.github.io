              Efficient Planar Pose Estimation via UWB Measurements
            </h2>
            <span>
              We investigate planar pose estimation using only UWB range
              measurements. We prove the excellent property of a two-step
              scheme, which says we can refine a consistent estimator to be
              asymptotically efficient by one step of Gauss-Newton iteration.
              Grounded on this result, we design the GN-ULS estimator, which
              reduces the computation time significantly compared to previous
              methods and presents the possibility of using only UWB for
              real-time state estimation.

            </h2>
            <span>
              Pose estimation is important for robotic perception, path
              planning, etc. Robot poses can be modeled on matrix Lie groups and
              are usually estimated via filter-based methods. In this work, we
              establish the closed-form formula for the error propagation for
              the Invariant extendedKalmanfilter (IEKF) in the presence of
              random noises and apply it to vision-aided inertial navigation.
              Moreover, we use the theoretic results to add the compensation
              parts for IEKF.We evaluate our algorithms via numerical
              simulations and experiments on the OPENVINS platform. Both
              simulations and the experiments performed on the public EuRoC MAV
              datasets demonstrate that our algorithm in particular parameters
              settings outperforms some state-of-art filter-based methods such
              as the quaternion-based EKF, first estimates Jacobian EKF, etc.
              The techniques of choice on the parameters are worth further
              investigating.

              CPnP: Consistent Pose Estimator for Perspective-n-Point Problem
              with Bias Elimination
            </h2>
            <span>
              The Perspective-n-Point (PnP) problem has been widely studied in
              both computer vision and photogrammetry societies. With the
              development of feature extraction techniques, a large number of
              feature points might be available in a single shot. It is
              promising to devise a consistent estimator, i.e., the estimate can
              converge to the true camera pose as the number of points
              increases. To this end, we propose a consistent PnP solver, named
              CPnP, with bias elimination. Specifically, linear equations are
              constructed from the original projection model via measurement
              model modification and variable elimination, based on which a
              closed-form least-squares solution is obtained. We then analyze
              and subtract the asymptotic bias of this solution, resulting in a
              consistent estimate. Additionally, Gauss-Newton (GN) iterations
              are executed to refine the consistent solution. Our proposed
              estimator is efficient in terms of computationsâ€”it has O(n) time
              complexity. Simulations and real dataset tests show that our
              proposed estimator is superior to some well-known ones for images
              with dense visual features, in terms of estimation precision and
              computing time.

              Global and Asymptotically Efficient Localization from Range
              Measurements
            </h2>
            <span>
              We consider the range-based localization problem, which involves
              estimating an objectâ€™s position by using m sensors, hoping that as
              the number m of sensors increases, the estimate converges to the
              true position with the minimum variance. We show that under some
              conditions on the sensor deployment and measurement noises, the LS
              estimator is strongly consistent and asymptotically normal.
              However, the LS problem is nonsmooth and nonconvex, and therefore
              hard to solve. We then devise realizable estimators that possess
              the same asymptotic properties as the LS one. These estimators are
              based on a two-step estimation architecture, which says that any
              âˆšm-consistent estimate followed by a one-step Gauss-Newton
              iteration can yield a solution that possesses the same asymptotic
              property as the LS one. The keypoint of the two-step scheme is to
              construct a âˆšm-consistent estimate in the first step. In terms of
              whether the variance of measurement noises is known or not, we
              propose the Bias-Eli estimator (which involves solving a
              generalized trust region subproblem) and the Noise-Est estimator
              (which is obtained by solving a convex problem), respectively.
              Both of them are proved to be âˆšm-consistent. Moreover, we show
              that by discarding the constraints in the above two optimization
              problems, the resulting closed-form estimators (called
              Bias-Eli-Lin and Noise-Est-Lin) are also âˆšm-consistent. Plenty of
              simulations verify the correctness of our theoretical claims,
              showing that the proposed two-step estimators can asymptotically
              achieve the Cramer-Rao lower bound.

              Localizability with Range-Difference Measurements: Numerical
              Computation and Error Bound Analysis
            </h2>
            <span>
              This project studies the localization problem using noisy
              range-difference measurements, or equivalently time difference of
              arrival (TDOA) measurements. There is a reference sensor, and for
              each other sensor, the TDOA measurement is obtained with respect
              to the reference one. By minimizing the sum of squared errors, a
              nonconvex constrained least squares (CLS) problem is formulated.
              In this work, we focus on devising an algorithm to seek the global
              minimizer of the CLS problem, hoping that the numerical solution
              meets some precision requirement in terms of relative error. Based
              on the Lagrange multiplier method, we first branch the feasible
              Lagrange multiplier set into several subsets and develop a
              workflow in terms of if-then-else control structure to seek the
              global minimizer by searching for the optimal Lagrange multiplier.
              The execution order is carefully organized so that it is in line
              with the general principle of putting the flow that one normally
              understands to be executed first. We then dive into detailed
              searching methods in different cases and conduct computational
              error analysis, giving the error bound on the Lagrange multiplier,
              when we search for it, to meet the precision requirement on an
              approximate solution. Based on the above achievements, a
              programmable global minimizer seeking algorithm is proposed for
              the CLS problem. Simulations and experimental tests on a public
              dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

              Low-complexity Distributed Detection with One-bit Memory Under
              Neyman-Pearson Criterion
            </h2>
            <span>
              We consider a multi-stage distributed detection scenario, where
              $n$ sensors and a fusion center (FC) are deployed to accomplish a
              binary hypothesis test. At each time stage, local sensors generate
              binary messages, assumed to be spatially and temporally
              independent given the hypothesis, and then upload them to the FC
              for global detection decision making. We suppose a one-bit memory
              is available at the FC to store its decision history and focus on
              developing iterative fusion schemes. We first visit the detection
              problem of performing the Neyman-Pearson (N-P) test at each stage
              and give an optimal algorithm, called the oracle algorithm, to
              solve it. Structural properties and limitation of the fusion
              performance in the asymptotic regime are explored for the oracle
              algorithm. We notice the computational inefficiency of the oracle
              fusion and propose a low-complexity alternative, for which the
              likelihood ratio (LR) test threshold is tuned in connection to the
              fusion decision history compressed in the one-bit memory. The
              low-complexity algorithm greatly brings down the computational
              complexity at each stage from O(4^n) (worst case) to O(n). We show
              that the proposed algorithm is capable of converging exponentially
              to the same detection probability as that of the oracle one.
              Moreover, the rate of convergence is shown to be asymptotically
              identical to that of the oracle algorithm. Finally, numerical
              simulations and real-world experiments demonstrate the
              effectiveness and efficiency of our distributed algorithm.

              MaskedXGBoost: Privacy-preserving Federated XGBoost with
              Differential Privacy Guarantee
            </h2>
            <span>
              We propose a variant of Vertical Federated XGBoost with a
              differential privacy guarantee: MaskedXGBoost. We build
              well-constructed noise to perturb the intermediate information to
              protect privacy, with nearly lossless accuracy and much lower
              overhead than encryption-based techniques. We build a label
              inference attacker to evaluate our approachâ€™s privacy-preserving
              empirically besides theoretical privacy analysis. The utility,
              efficiency, and empirical privacy of the protocol are verified on
              multiple datasets.

              Minimum-Degree Distributed Graph Filter Design
            </h2>
            <span>
              We establish fundamental connections between local response of
              shifting at a node, concerned in the GSP field, and the
              observability of the system, investigated in control theory.
              Specifically, by introducing a notion of observable graph
              frequencies to a node, we show that the output signals
              (observations) at a node only contain the spectral components of
              its so-called observable graph frequencies. We use low-pass graph
              filters as an example to illustrate the application of our
              proposed Algorithm 1 in computing a consensus value for a sensor
              network. We randomly generate an undirected graph of 7 nodes and
              treat the Laplacian matrix as the operator A with specific value.
              We compute the consensus value using the proposed node-variant GF
              and a minimum number of observations.
